## Projects
**School Shootings Across America 1970 - 2023**
For my capstone published project, I cleaned, transformed, and structured a dataset of 20,000+ school shooting incidents, using Python for data preparation before developing an interactive storyboard in Tableau. I built maps, charts, and timelines centered around an orange color palette symbolizing the fight against gun violence. The project converted raw data into a visual narrative designed to spark empathy, reflection, and public awareness.

**Monte Carlo Method with Random Walk Model for Advection Diffusion Processes**
Using Python, I simulated both diffusion and advection–diffusion processes across 200 steps to analyze particle behavior under varying conditions. The diffusion-only model produced a predictable spread (mean distance: 17.79 units, CI ±0.18), while introducing velocity nearly doubled the distance traveled (mean: 31.92 units) and increased variability. This project highlighted how external forces influence particle dispersion and demonstrated my ability to work with computational modeling and scientific simulations.

**Rodent Complaints in NYC**
I analyzed over 500,000 records of NYC rodent complaints, cleaning and organizing the dataset in Excel before building interactive visualizations in Tableau. The project featured a density heat map, a treemap of complaint categories, and a long-term trend line graph. Inspired by NYC’s yellow taxi aesthetic, I used a bold, accessible color scheme to enhance clarity and engagement. This project explored not only where and when rodent issues were most severe, but also how thoughtful design influences data interpretation.

**Global Child Labor (2010-2021)**
Working with a dataset of 2,000 global child labor records, I cleaned and prepared the data in Excel and visualized key patterns in Tableau. I focused on hazardous work, gender disparities, economic sectors, and hours worked, using filled-shape icons and a symbolic color palette to emphasize the human impact behind the data. The dark gray background with red-orange accents reflected the harsh realities of child labor, while blue and pink represented gender differences. This project aimed to bring visibility to an often overlooked global issue.
